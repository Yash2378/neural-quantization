**Rigorous exploration of neural network quantization techniques with focus on reproducible research and incremental improvements.**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Disclaimer

This is an early-stage research project with no working implementation yet. Previous claims about breakthrough performance were premature and based on theoretical projections rather than actual results.

**Current Status (~5% Complete):**
- ‚ùå No working quantization implementation
- ‚ùå Performance claims were theoretical projections  
- ‚ùå Demo contained simulated results, not real quantization
- ‚úÖ Honest research exploration with clear roadmap
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive literature review framework
- ‚úÖ Mathematical foundations established

## üéØ Research Mission

**Core Principle**: Advance quantization science through rigorous methodology, reproducible experiments, and honest reporting of both positive and negative results.

### Primary Research Questions
1. **Calibration Dataset Optimization**: Can domain-specific calibration strategies reduce quantization error by 10-15%?
2. **Hardware-Aware Quantization**: What performance gains are possible with CUDA kernel co-design?
3. **Progressive Quantization**: Do multi-stage approaches offer measurable benefits over single-stage methods?
4. **Evaluation Robustness**: Are current benchmarks sufficient for real-world deployment decisions?

### Phase 2: Novel Research Directions (Weeks 9-16)
**Target: January 2026**

#### Research Direction 1: **Adaptive Calibration Strategies**
**Research Gap**: Current methods use generic calibration datasets (C4, WikiText)

- **Progressive Calibration**: Multi-stage calibration with increasing complexity

**Expected Impact**: 5-10% improvement in domain-specific accuracy

**Implementation Plan**:
```python
# Week 9-10: Domain calibration framework
class DomainAwareCalibrator:
    def __init__(self, target_domain='code', diversity_factor=0.3):
        self.domain_sampler = DomainSpecificSampler(target_domain)
        self.diversity_factor = diversity_factor
    
    def generate_calibration_set(self, size=128):
        # Implementation for domain-matched calibration
        pass

# Week 11-12: Activation-guided quantization
class ActivationGuidedQuantizer:
    def __init__(self, sensitivity_threshold=0.1):
        self.sensitivity_map = {}
        self.threshold = sensitivity_threshold
```

- Profile memory access patterns during quantized inference
- Design quantization schemes that maximize CUDA occupancy

#### Research Direction 3: **Uncertainty-Aware Quantization**
**Research Gap**: Current methods don't account for model uncertainty

**Novel Approach**:
- **Confidence-Based Precision**: Higher precision for uncertain predictions
- **Ensemble Quantization**: Multiple quantization schemes with voting
- **Adaptive Precision**: Runtime precision adjustment based on input complexity

**Expected Impact**: Better accuracy-efficiency trade-offs, especially on out-of-distribution data

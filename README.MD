**Research exploration into neural network quantization techniques. Currently in early investigation phase.**

## ⚠️ Important Disclaimer

**This is an early-stage research project with no working implementation yet.** Previous claims about breakthrough performance were premature and based on theoretical projections rather than actual results. 

**Current Status:**
- ❌ No working quantization implementation
- ❌ Performance claims were theoretical projections
- ❌ Demo contained simulated results, not real quantization
- ✅ Honest research exploration moving forward

## 🎯 Research Goals

Investigating potential improvements to existing quantization methods:

- **Baseline Understanding**: Comprehensive study of GPTQ, AWQ, EXL3, and GGUF
- **Mathematical Analysis**: Information-theoretic limits of quantization approaches
- **Practical Validation**: When available, rigorous comparison against established methods
- **Open Research**: All findings, including negative results, will be shared publicly

## 📚 Current Focus: Learning Phase

### Literature Review Progress
- [ ] Information theory foundations of quantization
- [ ] GPTQ algorithm deep dive and implementation study
- [ ] AWQ activation-aware quantization principles
- [ ] EXL3 optimization techniques

### Technical Understanding Goals
- [ ] Implement basic GPTQ from paper
- [ ] Reproduce published benchmark results
- [ ] Understand calibration dataset requirements
- [ ] Study hardware-specific optimization techniques

**No production code exists yet.** This repository serves as a learning workspace and research log.

## 🔬 Research Questions

1. **Information Theory**: What are the fundamental limits of multi-stage quantization?
2. **Calibration**: Can domain-specific calibration datasets improve results?
3. **Hardware Optimization**: What kernel optimizations remain unexplored?
4. **Evaluation**: Are current benchmarks comprehensive enough?

## 🤝 How to Contribute

**Current needs:**
- Literature review and paper summaries
- Reference implementation studies
- Benchmark reproduction attempts
- Mathematical analysis of quantization limits

**Not ready for:**
- Production use (no working implementation)
- Performance comparisons (no original method yet)
- Integration with existing tools (research phase only)

## 📈 Research Log

### Recent Updates
- **2025-08**: Started comprehensive literature review
- **2025-08**: Removed misleading performance claims and fake demos
- **2025-08**: Committed to transparent research process

### Lessons Learned
- **Cascade Quantization**: Initial hypothesis about multi-stage benefits appears flawed based on information theory
- **Community Standards**: ML research community has extremely high standards for reproducibility
- **Implementation First**: Claims without working code are counterproductive

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Complete GPTQ Implementation**: Build working reference implementation
2. **Benchmark Reproduction**: Validate against published results
3. **Mathematical Analysis**: Rigorous study of quantization fundamentals
4. **Identify Real Gaps**: Find actual unsolved problems in quantization
5. **Honest Contribution**: Focus on incremental, validated improvements
